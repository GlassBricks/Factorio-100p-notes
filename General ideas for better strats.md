## Maximize bot time
Bots and roboports are expensive yet still often the bottleneck; we want to use them as efficiently as possible. This means minimizing bot travel distance, by moving build materials as close as possible to build site. See [[Possible new strats#Put (almost) everything on a construction belt]]

You also need roboports proportional to the amount of bots you have in order to utilize them, else charging queues can actually slow down long-term build times. Even still, in theory fewer bots travelling a short distance with fewer roboports should be faster than lots of bots travelling a long distance with more roboports. It's even better if the same number of roboports could be moved into a smaller space, hence [[Possible new strats#Roboport leapfrogging]].

This kind of strategy also requires not building (as many) outposts with base bots. See [[2-way train system]]

The power plaint needing to be in a separate location puts a wrinkle on things. See [[Possible new strats#Separate bot network for power]].

## Faster patch connections are better, even if more costly

If there is a strategy that allows connecting more resources faster, in the long-run almost any such strategy will outperform old ones, given that the base runs for so long.
Hence, the motivation for two-way rails despite costs, and maybe even spamming a lot more modules.
