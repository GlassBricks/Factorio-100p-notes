Why science first? Build GCs first! Either in outposts, or in the base.
### Pros
- Early GC production is theoretically more valuable as they run for longer.
- With [[#2-way train system for (almost) everything]], you an also belt back the GCs to be used for something!
### Cons
- Is it really any better, especially early game with tight resources, than to just belt ore back to base and produce tons of GCs there?
