 #early-game

Idea: Get a good chunk of the mall close to the patch; saves on belt and walking distance.
Suggested by Ximoltus

### Pros

- Cheaper, Faster; better early growth
- Possibly can chose a central location, reducing trip time to mall

### Cons

- Hard to find a good location, as on-patch uses a lot of space.
- Hard to know what should be produced
- Existing mall is already in good location for blue sci/bots; this limits removes resources
	- Earlier on-patch connection (bringing intermediates)?
