#early-game

Design base so train outpost can be up super early after bots (taking some products from starter mall).

### Pros

- Allows taking further patches as "starter" patches for mall
- Train delay might not be a problem (compared to an insane amount of belt delay)

### Cons

- Requires buffering up some (how many? bots).
	- Might be ok with insane amounts of belt production
- Requires lots of steel fast
	- If we do steel instead of red belt, this could be fine
