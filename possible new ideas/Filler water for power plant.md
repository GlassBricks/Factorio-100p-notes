#powerplant 

Design power plant to enable several "filler" pump lanes, to make up for pumps that didn't get placed.

### Pros

- Enables a ton more maps.
- We don't need a perfectly rectangular water portion anymore, or even a super big one.

### Cons

- Can be really, really, annoying to design. Especially with boiler pumps.
