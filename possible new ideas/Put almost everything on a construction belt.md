Put almost the entire mall on a construction belt.

Possibly want this to be on red belts to minimize belt delay.

### Pros

- Having resources in a more central location can save an ton of bot time.
- Can adapt this to help with [[#Super early train outpost]] or [[../Good strategies#Super early restock train]]

### Cons

- Will add additional belt delay. is it worth putting really expensive stuff on the belt?
