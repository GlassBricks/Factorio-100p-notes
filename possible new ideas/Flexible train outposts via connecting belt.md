#main-base 

Somewhat separate the mining from the train station, connected by belts the player build
And/or, design train station(s) that allow manually belting in "filler"/supplement lanes.

### Pros

- Especially good if going with strategy that allows patches to be any size (above train setup)
- Allows moving train station out of the way if it collides
- Allows still taking advantage of "small" patches without the full cost of a station

### Cons

- Now we need red belt or something again. Possibly in the outpost train as well
- It costs player time to do this. Is it worth it?
