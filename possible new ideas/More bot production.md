#early-game

### Pros

- can afford dumping bunch of bots at outposts
- player (maybe) doesn't need to to help bots as much

### Cons

- Roboport production also needs to scale up with bot production, else more bots becomes counterproductive due to charging queue issues.
	- Perhaps new mall designs can attempt to dynamically balance this?
- Early setup cost, but may be worth it.
