#late-game #main-base 

If we end up realizing we ant a absolutely colossal base, then at some point it could be worth breaking parts of the base out to outposts (e.g. iron or copper)

This might also allow Warger's old strat of basic iron outposts first, to scale up production even more before getting to main GC outposts.

### Pros

- Allows for much larger maximum base size. Maybe we need it
	- Reduced train congestion
	- Base takes up smaller footprint
	- Better bot management, potentially
	- Possibly cheaper logistics costs (if can find spot with multiple nearby patches)
- We only (maybe) need it very late game, where there should be a ton of accumulated bots and roboports and stuff. So the costs of doing so are manageable.

### Cons

- Based on Warger's old strat, very tricky to get right.
- May take a bunch of player time to set up
- Is it really worth it over just connecting everything to the base still?
