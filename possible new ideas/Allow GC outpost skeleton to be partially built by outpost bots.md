#gc-outpost
Put a bunch of skeleton stuff in the outpost train.
Stage the skeleton so outpost bots build some stuff.

### Pros

- Avoids having to run around in a weird circle, orphaning bots
- Makes being low on roboports less urgent.

### Cons

- Slightly longer startup time
- Bots need to finish skeleton first; more finicky for when to stamp the next stage
	- MORE ALARMS
