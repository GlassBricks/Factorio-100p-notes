#main-base

Build the base in a space-filling curve.
Deconstruct roboports in old stages, so you have extra in new stages.
Later stages may have an insane amount of roboports (that may need to be deconstructed again to make room for other stuff?u)
Space filling curve is better than straight line, to keep the mall somewhat central.

### Pros

- Allows roboports also scale up with bots, enabling a ton more bot time
	- This was previously not quite true as old roboports eventually get underutilized

### Cons

- Requires additional player actions.
- You still probably need _some_ connections to old parts of base. Puts burden on player to not deconstruct the wrong roboports.
