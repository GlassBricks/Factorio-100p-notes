#gc-outpost 

Put a stacker/bypass lane in every outpost, still allowing single-rail connections.
Use multiple build trains, each carrying different stuff
(e.g. modules last, like Warger once did).

The coordination of trains can be completely automated.

### Pros

- Enables the outpost to get started building even when not all (expensive) resources are ready.
- Allows restock train to go whenever.
- If putting modules as the last train, doesn't contribute to bot queue issues at all (modules in separate bot queue)

### Cons

- More space required for stacker.
- May need even more multi-stage outposts to use effectively
