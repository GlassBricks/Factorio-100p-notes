#powerplant 
May tie into above idea (connecting by train)

### Pros

- Bots don't have to fly back and forth a ton between main base and power
- Resources can be belted to central location for power plant
- These combined can save a _ton_ of bot time

### Cons

- Separate bot network means either lots of bot queue issues, or lots of tiny stages, or excessive bot overproduction
