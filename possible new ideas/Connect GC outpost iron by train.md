#gc-outpost 
This can be done probably via a p2p connection.
Another idea is to somehow connect it with the main rail network in a way that doesn't have trains running away to other outposts.

Signals can be pre-blueprinted to deal with crossing the outpost train rail.

### Pros

- Possibly saves time per outpost; just ghost rails. connecting iron to outposts is the longest part of setting up an outpost

### Cons

- Possibly more costly/bulky.
- Requires player to also start a train.
- Rail crossings may be annoying.
