#late-game 
This is basically mmkay's ideas.
The player stops doing stuff, and you have a global bot network (or maybe better, a network of separate networks, being expanded in parallel), and they do everything (like connect rails, GC outposts, fight biters with artillery, etc).

### Pros

- True essence of Factorio
- Theoretically faster, **when parallelized**, than anything the player can do by hand, even with tons of power armor
- Higher ceiling for exponential growth, can really push down the target time.
- Eventually reach theoretical maximum build rate of 10k entities per second.

### Cons

- Extreme infrastructure cost. Is it actually worth it in the end?
- Bots are slow, especially travelling long distance. This needs lots of parallelism to potentially be worth it.
- Lots of problems to solve (@mmkkkay)
