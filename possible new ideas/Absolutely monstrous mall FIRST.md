#mid-game #production-plan 

See also [[A better production plan]]

Scale up to a GC-outpost-scale-or-bigger mall FIRST. Get an insane number of production, bots, modules, etc.
Delay purple/yellow science as much as possible, except for a few critical techs (Asm 3s, beacons, bot speed?)
Then, build a much, much larger science.

### Pros

- Mathematically, it should be better to build a big mall and huge science, rather than a huge science and same size mall.
- Absolutely _massive_ scaling, and maybe enables new expensive strats (that may or may not be worth it). Like prod modules in everything
- Maybe having more expensive, red-belty speed-moduley outposts can be worth it?

### Cons

- We're assuming that player time won't become a bottleneck soon without power armor
- Now you need bigger later science; fancy techs might get researched late(r)
	- Most of the important stuff only needs blue sci, though
- RIP UPS
