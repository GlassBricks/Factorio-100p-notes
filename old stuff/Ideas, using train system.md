# Motivation
- With such a long run, faster outpost building is basically guaranteed to be faster overall (even if we need a bigger mall first)
- Current player utilization is inefficient
	- Time mostly spent on p2p trains/belt. Have to return to/from base almost every time
	- Trains system allows connecting same thing to multiple outposts, without having to return back to base every time. This can bring significant time savings (multiple minutes at least), especially when map is unfavorable.
	- Trains are faster to connect than red belt, and definitely cheaper than lots of red belt.
	- This makes us much less map dependent.
- Trains are more efficient/flexible than p2p connections:
	- Outposts don't have to meet some minimum size or mining prod rushed; outposts can optionally be larger than currently;
	- Further outposts are much less (marginally) costly.
	- Much less map dependent; outposts can almost essentially anywhere
# Cons
- Slower initial setup
	- Only after several (a few?) outposts may investment pay off.
- Train intersections are slightly slower to build
- Can't (easily) take advantage of super-close outposts, built by belt, freeing up train room.
	- I've decided the marginal costs maybe only 10 tiles anyways, because we can spaghetti stuff inside the train station
# Ideas
Taking into account all of the above:
- At _some point_ in exponential growth, dual-track rail system will be superior. The question is, when?

The optimal strategy for _one_ outpost depends on outpost distance:
- Super close: belts
- Closeish: 2 trains
- Further: 3 trains, 2 rails
- Further still: 3 trains, stacker (questionable)
- Further again: rail system

On site smelting costs the same entity wise, but might cost more in build time/infrastructure. The only advantage it allows further trains and less train congestion. See also [[Train station math]]
However, since it doesn't actually reduce the number of trains you need much (unless the stations themselves become much more expensive), and train congestion takes a while before it becomes an issue, on-site-smelting is probably not worth it, at least in the early-mid game where bots are still scarce.
