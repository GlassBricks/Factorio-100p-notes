These are strategies we're using almost for sure.

## Sushi/mixed everywhere
Including built by hand (for blue sci + bots).
Its simply just much cheaper and more compact and more cursed.
## Early combinators and alarms
Enables a ton of other strategies.
Early bot stamp alarm is super useful.
## Smoothly-ramped-up mall in early-mid game

Do some experiments; produce things in the order they're needed most.
Maybe in the following order.
- critical stuff first. belts, pipes, and steel furnaces?
- critical stuff for outposting. belt, train stuff??
- mall bootstrap. Assemblers, inserters, etc.
- More bots and roboports
- Everything else

Reduce belt delay as much as possible.
_Every_ stage of the mall should work even with limited resoures; i.e. should work ~50% when 50% of resources connected; 100% when 100% connected.

Possibly: steal extra copper from initial mall, to get some early circuits up
- A new design has 1 lane of extra copper

## Connect fuel to power by train
Much easier fuel connection! Even if its marginally more costly.
Maybe bots can build it too. This could also train in build materials.
This may require a tiny separate blueprint to interface the 2x2 grid with the 1x1 grid.

## Super early restock train

Saves several minutes from multiple trips back to base digging around in chests.
If base is scaling up faster, this becomes more and more important.
Allows you to say "goodbye base, I'll never see you again" after starter patches.
## Lots of speed modules for expensive production

Mostly just for prod/speed 3s.
When the reduced cost of internal buffers outweighs the cost of the materials produced 

## Power armor before rocket
Depends on [[Possible new strats#Don't rely on logistics bots _at all_]]
Rocket and power armor mk2 share much of the same resources. And both need to be produced anyways.
If rocket can be delayed as much as we want, then we should prioritize all those resources (possibly in chest buffers) to power armor before the rocket even starts crafting.

## Tanks and shields in the resupply train
Allows doing the final few achievements from anywhere; don't have to run back to base.

## Moderately modular base
Design base so it's possible to expand/shrink/alter production of major items easily (mainly science, GC mall, expensive resources), while still being efficient.
I.e let one side of the base possibly expand/contract, by adding/removing modules.
Standarize connection of roboports, construction belt, product belt(s), rails.

Like a server rack. Lots of modules with standard interfaces... connected by spaghetti.
